   ```

## Usage

1. Import Football Data:

   ```bash
   python import_data.py data.csv
   ```

2. Run Football Analysis:

   python analyze.py
   ```

3. Create Custom Queries:

   ```sql
   python custom_queries.py
   ```

## Example Queries

Here are some example SQL queries you can use to analyze football data:

1. List all matches in a specific season:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM matches WHERE season = '2007-2016';
   ```

2. Calculate the average goals per match:

   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(home_goals + away_goals) AS avg_goals FROM matches;
   ```

3. Find the team with the most wins:

   ```sql
   SELECT team, COUNT(*) AS avg_goals FROM matches WHERE result = 'avg_goals' GROUP BY team ORDER BY wins DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```
